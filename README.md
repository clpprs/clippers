# CLIPPERS

less goo

## To Do:

- [ ] Disable links until all clips are unselected
- [x] Add death.png and reisir.png to navbar
- [x] Make \<Sidebar\> reusable, remove the content and make it render children
- [ ] Update the browse page when tagging
- [x] Make browse grid size and wrap better with min-width and probably a max-width too
- [x] Sidebar subtitle positioning when changing from exclude to include
- [ ] Re-process the clips without auto-cropping black bars out
- [ ] Style headings better
- [ ] Consider different fonts
- [ ] Fix margins in context menu
- [ ] ZIP downloads with https://github.com/Touffy/client-zip
- [ ] Hover over tags in sidebar to highlight videos that match
- [ ] Page titles, maybe useEffect() ?
- [ ] Use onMouseDown to remove the dragging thing on videos ?
